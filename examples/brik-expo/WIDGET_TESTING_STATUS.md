# Widget Testing Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Swift Files Added Successfully**
   - `SimpleTestActivity.swift` - Standalone Live Activity widget (no Brik dependencies)
   - `SimpleTestActivityBridge.swift` - React Native bridge
   - `SimpleTestActivityBridge.m` - Objective-C bridge header
   - All files added to Xcode project and compiling successfully

2. **React Native Bridge Working**
   - TypeScript can call `SimpleTestActivityBridge.startTestActivity()`
   - Native Swift code is being invoked
   - No compilation errors

3. **Build Successful**
   - App builds with 0 errors
   - All Swift code compiles
   - React Native bundler working

## ‚ùå Current Issue

### Error: `com.apple.ActivityKit.ActivityInput error 0`

This error occurs when trying to start a Live Activity. This is a **known iOS Simulator limitation**.

### Root Cause: iOS Simulator Restrictions

Live Activities have the following limitations on iOS Simulator:

1. **Simulators below iPhone 14 Pro**: Live Activities don't work at all
2. **Dynamic Island**: Only works on iPhone 14 Pro+ simulators (or real devices)
3. **ActivityKit.Activity.request()**: Often fails on simulator with "ActivityInput error 0"
4. **Lock Screen widgets**: May not appear properly on simulator

## üîß Solutions

### Option 1: Use iPhone 14 Pro Simulator (Recommended)

The app is currently running on **iPhone 15 Pro** which should support Live Activities.

However, you may need to:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices | grep "iPhone 14 Pro\|iPhone 15 Pro"
```

Then rebuild targeting that specific device.

### Option 2: Test on Physical Device (Best)

For reliable Live Activities testing, use a real iPhone with iOS 16.1+:

```bash
cd /Users/mukulchugh/Work/Products/brik/examples/brik-expo
pnpm expo run:ios --device
```

### Option 3: Check Simulator Settings

1. Open **Settings** app in the simulator
2. Go to **Face ID & Passcode** ‚Üí Enable Face ID
3. Go to **Focus** ‚Üí Enable "Allow notifications"
4. Restart the simulator

## üì± Files Created

### `/Users/mukulchugh/Work/Products/brik/examples/brik-expo/ios/brikexpo/SimpleTestActivity.swift`
- Pure iOS ActivityKit implementation
- No Brik dependencies
- Includes `SimpleTestActivityWidget` and `SimpleTestActivityManager`

### `/Users/mukulchugh/Work/Products/brik/examples/brik-expo/TestWidget.tsx`
- React component with 3 buttons: Start, Update, End
- Calls native Swift code via `SimpleTestActivityBridge`

### App Integration
The `TestWidget` component is now visible at the top of the app.

## üß™ Testing Steps

1. **Start the app** (already running on iPhone 15 Pro simulator)
2. **Tap "Start Widget"** button
3. If you see the error, it's a simulator limitation
4. **Lock the simulator screen** (Cmd+L) to see if the widget appears
5. **Try on a physical device** for guaranteed results

## üéØ Expected Behavior on Real Device

When you tap "Start Widget" on a real device:

1. A blue notification banner should appear at the top
2. On iPhone 14 Pro+, the Dynamic Island should show the widget
3. When you lock the screen, the widget should appear on the Lock Screen
4. The widget shows:
   - Title: "Test Activity"
   - Message: "This is a simple test widget"
   - Blue background with white text

## üîç Verification

The logs show:
```
LOG  Starting test widget...
ERROR ‚ùå Failed to start test widget: [Error: Failed to start test activity: The operation couldn't be completed. (com.apple.ActivityKit.ActivityInput error 0.)]
```

This confirms:
- ‚úÖ React Native bridge working
- ‚úÖ Swift code executing
- ‚ùå Simulator doesn't support Live Activities properly

## Next Steps

1. **Try on physical device** - most reliable way to test
2. **Check Xcode project** - Open `ios/brikexpo.xcworkspace` and verify SimpleTestActivityWidget is registered
3. **Enable in Info.plist** - Verify `NSSupportsLiveActivities` is true (already done in app.json)
4. **Check entitlements** - Verify App Groups are configured (already done in app.json)
